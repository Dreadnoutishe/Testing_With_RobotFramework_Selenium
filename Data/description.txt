Project Title: Automated Website Testing – Practice Automation
Author: Eltore Zhaksymurat
Tool: Robot Framework + SeleniumLibrary
Browser: Google Chrome (Chromedriver)

------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
This project automates the testing of multiple web functionalities
on the practice-automation.com website using Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary.

The goal is to verify that various user interface elements —
such as forms, buttons, and sliders — work correctly and respond
as expected. Each test file is dedicated to a specific feature
and ensures the stability and correctness of that part of the site.

------------------------------------------------------------
TEST CASES OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Form_Testing.robot**
   - Opens the “Form Fields” page.
   - Fills out all form fields (name, password, drinks, favorite color, email, and message).
   - Selects an option from the dropdown (“Do you like automation?”).
   - Submits the form and handles the alert message confirming successful submission.
   - Purpose: To validate data entry, field visibility, and form submission behavior.

2. **Click_Testing.robot**
   - Navigates to the “Click Events” page.
   - Clicks each animal button (Cat, Dog, Pig, Cow).
   - Verifies that the correct text (“Meow!”, “Woof!”, “Oink!”, “Moo!”) appears for each click.
   - Purpose: To ensure all clickable buttons trigger the right JavaScript response.

3. **Slider_Testing.robot**
   - Opens the “Sliders” page.
   - Adjusts the slider value to 100 and back to 0 using JavaScript.
   - Confirms that the displayed value updates correctly.
   - Purpose: To test slider interactivity and real-time value updates.

4. **Ads_Testing.robot**
   - (Example placeholder – can be used for ad pop-up or navigation testing.)
   - Ensures that ad-related elements load correctly and do not block user interaction.
   - Purpose: To check user experience flow and ensure no element overlap occurs.
